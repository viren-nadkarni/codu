1.
#!/bin/sh
#Shell script to find the length of the string

string="Operating system"
echo ${#string}
expr index "Operating system" "t"
echo $string"s"


2.
#!/bin/sh
#Shell script to find the length of the string
for i in `seq 1 6` 
do
for j in `seq 1 $i` 
do
printf $i
done
echo " "
done


3.1)
save that table in a file called table
#!/bin/sh
#Shell script to find the length of the string
echo "comp"
grep "comp" table
echo "mech"
grep "mech" table
echo "electronics"
grep "electronics" table
echo "ene"
grep "ene" table
echo "civil"
grep "civil" table
echo "it"
